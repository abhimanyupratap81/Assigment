A for loop is used when the number of iterations is known beforehand, as it iterates over a sequence such as a list, tuple, string, or range. On the other hand, a while loop is used when the number of iterations is unknown and depends on a condition being met.\n",

        "The for loop is best for iterating through collections or performing a fixed number of repetitions. For example, if you want to print each element in a list, a for loop is the ideal choice. It automatically stops after iterating through all the elements, reducing the risk of infinite loops. A common use case of for loops is iterating through a range of numbers, such as for i in range(1, 6): print(i), which prints numbers from 1 to 5.\n",
        "\n",
        "On the other hand, a while loop continues running as long as a condition is True, making it suitable for situations where you don’t know in advance how many iterations are needed. For example, a program that asks for user input until a correct password is entered would use a while loop. However, because the condition must eventually become False, it's essential to ensure that the loop has an exit condition; otherwise, it can lead to an infinite loop.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, use a for loop when iterating over a sequence or when the number of iterations is predetermined. Use a while loop when repeating an action until a condition is met. Understanding when to use each loop helps in writing efficient and bug-free Python programs."
