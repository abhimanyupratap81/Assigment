        "# What is the significance of the Flask-RESTful extension?\n",
        "\n",
        "--> The Flask-RESTful extension is significant because it simplifies the process of building RESTful APIs with Flask by providing a structured and efficient way to define resources and handle HTTP methods. Instead of manually managing routes and request parsing, Flask-RESTful allows you to create classes that represent resources, and map them to URLs. Each class can define methods like get(), post(), put(), and delete() to handle specific HTTP requests, making the code more organized and readable.\n",
        "\n",
        "Additionally, Flask-RESTful includes built-in tools for input validation and request parsing using its reqparse module, which helps handle incoming data cleanly and securely. It also integrates well with Flask's native features and supports returning consistent, automatically formatted JSON responses. Overall, Flask-RESTful streamlines REST API development by reducing boilerplate code and encouraging best practices, making it easier to scale and maintain Flask-based APIs.\n",

        "\n",
        "--> The role of Flaskâ€™s session object is to store data specific to a user across multiple requests, allowing you to maintain state between page loads or API calls. It acts like a temporary storage mechanism for individual usersâ€”often used for things like tracking login status, storing user preferences, or maintaining a shopping cart.\n",
        "\n",
        "Flask's session data is stored on the client side inside a secure cookie, which is signed using the appâ€™s secret key to prevent tampering. Although the data is stored on the client, Flask ensures its integrity by verifying that it hasnâ€™t been modified. This makes the session object a lightweight and secure way to persist small pieces of user-related information without needing a full database call for every request."
