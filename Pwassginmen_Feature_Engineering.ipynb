A lower loss value generally means that the model’s predictions are closer to the true outputs, indicating better performance. During training, the loss helps guide the learning process—if the loss decreases over time, it suggests the model is learning meaningful patterns from the data. Moreover, comparing loss values on training and validation sets can reveal important insights: for example, if the training loss continues to decrease but the validation loss starts increasing, this may indicate overfitting, where the model memorizes the training data but fails to generalize to unseen data. Loss functions also help in optimizing the model by informing algorithms like gradient descent how to adjust the model’s internal parameters. Although the loss is a powerful tool for evaluating model quality, it is typically used alongside other metrics like accuracy or F1-score, especially in classification problems, to get a more complete picture of performance.\n",

In other words, if variable X causes variable Y, then changing X will result in a change in Y. This is different from correlation, which simply measures the statistical association between two variables—how they move together—but does not imply that one causes the other. For example, there may be a correlation between ice cream sales and drowning incidents, as both tend to increase during the summer. However, eating ice cream does not cause drowning; a third factor (hot weather) is influencing both. This is correlation without causation. On the other hand, pressing the accelerator pedal in a car causes it to speed up—this is a clear example of causation, where one action directly affects the outcome. Understanding the difference is critical in data analysis and machine learning, because while correlation can help identify patterns or relationships, only causation can support reliable decision-making and explain why those patterns exist."
